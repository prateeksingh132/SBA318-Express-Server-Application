//////// GadgetShack product controller

// Goal: this file handles the logic for product routes.
// i separated this from the routes file to keep my code organized (modularization).
// this will help in later as well during capstone when logic gets complicated.

import { products } from "../database/data.js";

// get all products (with filtering)
export const getAllProducts = (req, res) => {
    
};

// create new product
export const createProduct = (req, res, next) => {
    
};

// delete product
export const deleteProduct = (req, res) => {
    
};

// show edit form
export const showEditForm = (req, res) => {
    
};

// update product (patch)
export const updateProduct = (req, res) => {

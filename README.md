# SBA 318: Express Server Application

## Project: GadgetShack (Backend Layer)

**Brief Description:**




# Technology Used



# Features




# Testing

I have created (and used during code creation) test points (log statement) at multiple places in the code, I have not removed them. They are commented at the time of submission and can be uncommented for future debugging and code check. These code checks looks something like:


////////////TESTING

//console.log('TESTING: assignment: ', assignment);

////////////



# Reflection


**What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?**




**Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?**



**What would you add to,or change about your application if given more time?**




**Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again**
